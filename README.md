# ccnahomelab
Basic configuration of a homelab to get internet connectivty at home using Cisco equipment.
The goal of this repository is to document my journey in applying the knowledge gained during my studies for the CCNA exam in a real lab. I faced several challenges in setting up this basic topology. This showed me that knowing the theory and doing packet tracer labs, although essential, are not enough. For example, I got a Cisco Router 819. It only has one Layer 3 routable port - GigabitEthernet 0. This is the port connected to the modem. Therefore, ROA (Router on a stick) would not work for this configuration. SVIs were the solution. 

 Please read the document Practical CCNA Home Lab Setup: Internet Access via Cisco Devices. I go through each configuration, the errors encountered and what I had to do make it work.
